# Privacy Policy for MicroFocus Zones

**Effective date:** December 2, 2025  

This Privacy Policy describes how the browser extension **MicroFocus Zones** (the "Extension") provided by **Hayk Jomardyan** ("we", "us", or "our") handles information when used in supported browsers, including Google Chrome and Microsoft Edge.

By installing or using the Extension, you acknowledge that you have read and understood this Privacy Policy.

## 1. Scope

This Privacy Policy applies solely to the Extension as distributed through:
- The Chrome Web Store for Google Chrome and other Chromium-based browsers.
- The Microsoft Edge Add-ons store for Microsoft Edge.

It does not apply to any websites, services, or applications that may be linked from the Extension but are operated by third parties under their own privacy policies.

## 2. Data Collection and Processing

The Extension is designed with privacy as a core principle:

- **No Personal Information Collection**: The Extension does **not** collect, store, or process any personally identifiable information (PII) such as your name, email address, or contact information.
- **No External Data Transmission**: The Extension does **not** transmit any of your data to external servers, third-party services, or our servers.
- **No Browsing History Collection**: The Extension does **not** collect or store your complete browsing history.
- **No Tracking**: The Extension does **not** track your behavior across websites, perform profiling, or use analytics services.
- **No IP Address or Device Information**: The Extension does **not** collect your IP address, device identifiers, or system information.

## 3. Local Data Storage

The Extension stores certain data locally in your browser to provide its core functionality:

### What is Stored Locally:
- **Tasks and Zones**: Task titles, notes, and associated color preferences you create
- **Tab Information**: URLs, page titles, and scroll positions of tabs you explicitly capture within a task
- **Session Data**: Active task information, timer settings, and temporary override decisions
- **Usage Statistics**: Local statistics including total focus time, session counts, and streak data
- **Settings and Preferences**: Your theme preference, break reminder settings, and focus goals
- **Session History**: Records of completed focus sessions with task titles, durations, and session metrics

### How Local Storage Works:
- All data is stored exclusively in your browser's local storage using the Chrome/Edge storage API
- No data leaves your device or browser
- You maintain complete control over this data
- Data is not accessible to us or any third parties
- Uninstalling the Extension will remove all locally stored data

## 4. Browser Permissions Explained

The Extension requests specific browser permissions to function properly. Here's what each permission is used for:

- **tabs**: Required to access tab information (URLs, titles) for relevance checking and tab management
- **storage**: Required to save your tasks, settings, and preferences locally in your browser
- **sidePanel**: Required to display the Extension's side panel interface
- **scripting**: Required to inject content scripts that display focus overlays and gates on web pages
- **alarms**: Required to trigger focus timers and break reminders at scheduled times
- **tabGroups**: Required for future tab grouping functionality
- **notifications**: Required to send browser notifications for timer completion and break reminders
- **host_permissions (<all_urls>)**: Required to evaluate tab relevance and display focus gates on any website you visit

**Important**: These permissions enable functionality but do NOT mean we collect or transmit your data. All processing happens locally on your device.

## 5. Notifications

The Extension sends browser notifications for:
- Zone activation and deactivation
- Focus timer completion
- Break time reminders (if enabled)
- Session completion summaries

These notifications are generated locally by your browser and contain only information you've provided (task titles, session durations). No notification data is collected or transmitted externally.

## 6. No Third-Party Services

- The Extension does **not** use third-party analytics tools, advertising networks, or tracking services
- The Extension does **not** embed third-party SDKs or scripts for data collection
- The Extension does **not** share any information with third parties
- The Extension operates entirely offline after installation

## 7. Content Script Behavior

The Extension injects content scripts on web pages to:
- Display focus gates when you navigate to potentially off-task websites
- Apply visual overlays to help you stay focused
- Communicate your gate decisions (allow, block, break) back to the Extension

These content scripts:
- Only run when you have an active focus zone
- Do not read or collect page content
- Do not modify website functionality beyond displaying the overlay
- Do not transmit any information about the pages you visit

## 8. Children's Privacy

Because the Extension does not collect, store, or process any personal information on external servers, it does not knowingly collect information from children under the age of 13 (or applicable age in your jurisdiction). All data remains local to the user's device.

If this changes in a future version, this Privacy Policy will be updated to reflect applicable requirements for children's data protection.

## 9. Data Retention and Deletion

Since all data is stored locally in your browser:

- **Session History**: Limited to the last 50 sessions automatically
- **Tasks and Settings**: Retained until you manually delete them or uninstall the Extension
- **Export Capability**: You can export your session history as a CSV file at any time

### How to Delete Your Data:
- Delete individual tasks through the Extension's interface
- Clear all data by uninstalling the Extension from your browser
- Use your browser's built-in storage management tools to clear Extension data

## 10. User Rights and Controls

You have complete control over your data:

- **Access**: View all your tasks, settings, and session history through the Extension interface
- **Modification**: Edit or update tasks, preferences, and settings at any time
- **Export**: Download your session history as a CSV file
- **Deletion**: Delete tasks individually or remove all data by uninstalling
- **Portability**: Your exported CSV data can be used in other applications

Since no data is collected on our servers, there is no personal data for us to access, modify, or delete on your behalf.

## 11. International Data Transfers

Because the Extension does not collect or transmit personal data to external servers, there are no international transfers of personal data. All data processing occurs locally on your device, regardless of your geographic location.

## 12. Security

While we do not collect your data, we take security seriously:

- All data remains on your device, protected by your browser's security measures
- The Extension follows Chrome and Edge security best practices
- We use Manifest V3, the latest and most secure extension framework
- No external network requests are made for data collection purposes
- Regular updates address any security vulnerabilities

## 13. Changes to This Privacy Policy

We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time to reflect:
- Changes in Extension functionality or behavior
- Updates to applicable laws, regulations, or browser store policies
- Improvements in privacy practices

When changes are made:
- The "Effective date" at the top will be updated
- Material changes will be reflected in the Chrome Web Store and Microsoft Edge Add-ons listings
